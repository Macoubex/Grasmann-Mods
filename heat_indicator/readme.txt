Description :
When charging the Bolt staff or Fireball staff, a colored marker will be shown on the HUD
indicating the current 'charge level'.
The Bolt staff has discrete charge levels, which are shown as: green=1, orange=2, red=3.
The Fireball staff doesn't have discrete levels and charging just continuously increases damage and area, 
so the levels I've chosen are kind of arbitrary: 
green=(3 <= damage < 5, 0.75 <= area < 2.25), orange=(5 <= damage < 6, 2.25 <= area < 3), red=(damage = 6, area = 3).
Where 'damage' means AoE instantaneous damage to normal targets, not including impact damage or DoT.
