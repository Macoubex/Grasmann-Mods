description = "[b]Lets players dare each other for random things.[/b]
Version: 1.0.9b

[h1]Concept[/h1]
The server will roll two people. One selecting a dare and a victim for the dare.
A dare might be something like 'don't block', 'don't dodge' or 'jump continuously'.
Each dare is active for 10-60 seconds ( times can be configured in mod options ).
If the victim fails to comply it gets punished.
If the victim gets knocked down or killed the dare ends.
After a dare ended the server will roll two new players and the next one starts.

One dare in the selection can be a party dare that will affect everyone using the mod.
This feature can be turned off and the percentual chance can be set in the mod options.
Party dares are displayed in yellow text in the selection.

[u]Feedback / Suggestions / Error Reports[/u]

If you have any errors please give me a console log.
They can be found under '%appdata%\Fatshark\Vermintide 2\console_logs'.
